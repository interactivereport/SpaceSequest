# Please be causion of changing the following default filtering
# More details can be found: section 2.4 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35743881/
# Apply the 2nd round of biostats filtering.  For "group" mode, the filtering is applied to `ref_group` and `alt_group` for the given cell type of interest.
R6_min.genes.per.cell: 250 # keep cells with expression in at least min.genes.per.cell genes.
R6_min.cells.per.gene: 3 #minimum cells expressed per gene.  This filter is applied if it is larger than 0
R6_min.perc.cells.per.gene: 0.1 # minimum % cells expressed per gene filtering (use decimal form of percentage).  This threshold is applied if it is between 0 and 1
R6_min.cells.per.gene.type: "or" #The type of cell per gene filtering.  If it has the value "and" then it requires the gene be expressed in both reference and non-reference groups. If it has the value "or" then it requires the gene be expressed in either group
R6_perc_threshold: 0.75 #Percentile threshold, 75th percentile is default.  Express percentile as a decimal value. If it is 1, no percentile filtering
R6_perc.filter.type: "and" #The type of percentile gene filtering.  If it has the value "and" then any gene that has 75th percentile of zero in both groups will be filtered out.  If it has the value "or" then any gene that has a 75th percentile of zero in either group will be filtered out.
R6_min.ave.pseudo.bulk.cpm: 1 #cpm filtering threshold
R6_min.cells.per.subj: 3 #Minimum cells required per subject, must be a nonzero number, used when pseudo bulk needed for DESeq2
